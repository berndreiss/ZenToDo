# ZenToDo

A simple ToDo-List that let's you focus on what's really important.

This project implements a hands-on ToDo-List for Android. The idea is simple: you drop tasks that come to your mind so you don't have to think about them anymore. Then you only PICK tasks you want to get done. The others can be assigned reminder dates or lists. The tasks you picked are shown in FOCUS and represent thins that are really important right now. Tasks with a reminder date will not be shown until that date again. There is also an option to make tasks recurring. Or you just leave them in a list.

The App contains the following main layouts:

## DROP

Add new tasks, so you don't have to worry about them.
